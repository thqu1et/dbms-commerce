This trigger is designed to be fired before an update on the "cards" table. It checks the balance of the payment associated with the card being updated and ensures that the payment amount is not greater than the card's balance. If the payment amount is greater, the trigger subtracts the payment amount from the card's balance and outputs "Accepted" using the DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE function. If the payment amount is less than the card's balance, it raises an application error with the message "Transaction amount does not match balance".

However, there are a few improvements that could be made to this trigger. First, it's a good practice to explicitly specify the column names in the SELECT statement rather than using "SELECT *". This can help prevent issues in case the table schema changes in the future.

Second, it would be a good idea to add some additional error handling code to catch any unexpected errors that may occur during the execution of the trigger. For example, if there is an error during the SELECT statement, the trigger will raise a runtime error. To handle this, we can add an EXCEPTION block to catch any errors and log them using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE or some other mechanism.

Finally, it's worth noting that the use of DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE is not ideal in a trigger, as triggers are often executed within the context of a larger transaction and DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE output may not be visible outside the trigger. Instead, consider using a logging table or some other mechanism to record the trigger's output.

create or replace trigger pay_trigger

declare 
    check_balance number;
begin 
    select payment_sum into check_balance from payment where payment_id = :new.payment_id;    if :new.cards_balance > check_balance then 
        :new.cards_balance := :new.cards_balance - check_balance ;        	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Accepted');

   IF :new.cards_balance < check_balance THEN
      RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Transaction amount does not match balance');    END IF;

The above code block is a PL/SQL anonymous block that updates the salary of all the staff members in a table named "staff" and then checks whether any rows have been affected by the update statement.

The first line of code declares a variable "total_rows" of type number(2) to store the number of rows affected by the update statement.

The second line of code updates the "salary" column of all rows in the "staff" table by adding 500 to the current value.

The IF statement checks whether any rows have been affected by the update statement. If no rows have been affected, it outputs "no staff selected" using the dbms_output.put_line() procedure.

If rows have been affected, the "total_rows" variable is assigned the number of rows affected by the update statement using the sql%rowcount attribute. The number of rows affected is then outputted using the dbms_output.put_line() procedure.

Overall, this PL/SQL block updates the salaries of all staff members and then provides feedback on whether any rows were updated or not.

//

DECLARE  
   total_rows number(2); 
BEGIN 
   UPDATE staff 
   SET salary = salary + 500; 
   IF sql%notfound THEN 
      dbms_output.put_line('no staff selected'); 
   ELSIF sql%found THEN 
      total_rows := sql%rowcount;
      dbms_output.put_line( total_rows || ' staff selected '); 
   END IF;  
END;

This PL/SQL code block creates a stored procedure named "group_by_info" that retrieves and outputs product category information.

The procedure uses a cursor named "products_info" to retrieve data from two tables named "PRODUCT_END" and "TYPE_END". The cursor selects two columns, "product_block" from the "PRODUCT_END" table and "type_block" from the "TYPE_END" table.

The SELECT statement also contains a WHERE clause that joins the two tables on the "product_block" and "type_block" columns, filtering the results to only include matching rows.

The GROUP BY clause groups the resulting rows by "product_block" and "type_block" columns.

Inside the procedure, the dbms_output.put_line() procedure is used to output the string "Product Category" to the console.

A FOR loop is used to iterate through the rows returned by the cursor, and for each row, the dbms_output.put_line() procedure is called to output the "type_block" value to the console.

Overall, this procedure retrieves and outputs product category information by joining two tables, grouping the results, and outputting the results using the dbms_output.put_line() procedure.

//

create or replace procedure group_by_info is
cursor products_info is 
Select p.product_block , s.type_block  
from PRODUCT_END p ,TYPE_END s 
where p.product_block = s.type_block
group by p.product_block , s.type_block;
begin 
dbms_output.put_line('Product Category ');
for product_cat in products_info loop
dbms_output.put_line(product_cat.type_block);
end loop;
end;

The above code block is a PL/SQL code that creates a stored function named "count_products" that retrieves the number of products stored in a table named "product_end" and returns the count as a number.

The function begins by declaring a local variable named "num_products" of type number.

The SELECT statement inside the function selects the count of all rows in the "product_end" table using the COUNT(*) function and stores the result into the "num_products" variable using the INTO clause.

Finally, the function returns the value of the "num_products" variable using the RETURN statement.

Overall, this function can be used to retrieve the number of products stored in the "product_end" table in a PL/SQL program or as a part of an SQL statement.

//

create or replace function count_products return number as 
num_products number;
begin 
select count(*) into num_products from product_end;
return num_products;
end;
